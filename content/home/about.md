# Biography
Since August 2015, I am a tenure-track assistant professor of mathematics
at Jackson State University. 
Right before that, I obtained my Ph.D. from Southern Illinois University Carbondale
under the advising of Dr. Mingqing Xiao.
I have conducted many interesting research on several different topics, 
published about 15 articles in high-quality journals, 
and presented many research talks in professional conferences and seminars.
I has received Student Travel Awards from both SIAM and IEEE, 
as well as travel support to participate in numerous research workshops 
organized by SAMSI, IMA, and AIM, respectively.
